# Advent of Code 2024 solutions - Written in Go ðŸ’»

Thought I'd pick up a new programming language, one that I've been wanting to learn for a while now: Go!

AoC is often hard enough as is, but the added challenge of learning a brand new language, especially one so unique as Go is in its syntax and libraries and conventions... It's sure gonna be a ride.

Happy Hacking folks!
